# Driver_LIS3DSH

This driver is usable for STMicroelectronics' LIS3DSH accelerometer.
To use it, simply run main.c including YNV_LIS3DSH.h and YNV_LIS3DSH.c in the project. 

You have access to several parameters (accuracy, refresh rate...) in order to configure this sensor according to your application.
